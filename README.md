# work-day-scheduler
a scheduler to log events

## Description

I built this simple day planner with the functionality to input and save hourly events throughout a standard workday to keep the user organized and oriented. I learned how to connect a current moment function and compare it with existing elements to colour-code based on time of day and how to save objects into local storage and recall so that they do not disappear upon reload of the page.
