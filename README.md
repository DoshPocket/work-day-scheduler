# work-day-scheduler
a scheduler to log events, featuring a live time/ date

## Description

I built this project primarily to put into practice and further develop my skills in logic and specifically javascript. I created a full quiz of five questions that, based on your answers, will award or deduct time, affecting your final score on the quiz. It was an immense challenge for me to build and I learned how to more effectively implement event listeners, local storage, and timers.
